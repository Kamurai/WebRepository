Scripting should allow a site to edit the content of an IDed element, ie:

To simulate a dynamic navigation menu, one should be able to reassign the value on the fly, in reaction to something like a click.
 
Javascript eg:  document.getElementById("navigation").innerHTML = "whatever";
  
This should require “collapsible” symbols which are essentially links.
                    These symbols should change to represent whether clicking it will collapse (-) or expand (+)
  
This can be used on all the sections of a page to simulate navigating to a new page without actually leaving the page.
                    This means it has to be done on all pages, with a unique default value for each page.
                    This means when simulated navigation occurs, it has to occur on all relevant sections.
  
 
 
This can go on the to do list for each scripting language.
Redefining the table layout to a div structure should be on the do list site wide.



Site wide: add Python links
Python: Add function calls in Layout
		common_globals = {'getHeader': Universal.getHeader,
						  'getCSS': Universal.getCSS,
						  'getHead': Universal.getHead,
						  'getNavBar': Universal.getNavBar}
		Main = web.template.render('templates/')
		Section1 = web.template.render('templates/Section1/', globals=common_globals)
		Section2 = web.template.render('templates/Section2/', globals=common_globals)
		Section3 = web.template.render('templates/Section3/', globals=common_globals)
	 
HTML: Fix embedding 
CSS: Fix spacing
Layout: Switch to DIVs

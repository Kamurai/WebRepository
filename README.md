## Description:
* This is currently a back up for my site.  It mainly used to learn new languages and technologies.

## Application URL:
* http://htkb.dyndns.org

## Technologies Used:
* Apache Tomcat, HTML, CSS, PHP, Perl CGI-BIN, Apache SSI, Javascript, JQuery
* IIS, ASP.NET: Webform, Web Application, MVC, Classic ASP
* Glassfish, JSF, JSP
* Python Web.py
* Ruby on Rails
* Node JS

* Oracle 11g, SQL Server Express, SQL Server 2014, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Derby

## Future Features:
* Currently adding JQuery version.
* Anjular JS version.
* Updating table HTML structure to use a newer Div / Div inline block structure

* Over project needs the following:
* * New logos
* * Update CSS:
* * * Media query
* * Secure text fields / database requests

## Particular Challenges:
* Format: Every technology has different requirements, possibly a new IDE, or might require other new technologies.
* Port Management: In order to serve multiple technologies on the same server through the same URL, multiple ports have to be used. E.g. IIS can't listen on the same port as Apache Tomcat
* Syntax:  Each language has its own particular syntax, though it is sometimes similar to others, with important differences.
* Databases: Each technology has different ways to connect to a database, if it is even possible, e.g. Derby only seems to be accessible through Java.
